On a clean surface or in a large mixing bowl, pour the flour and create a well in the center.\\n2. Crack the eggs into the well and add the salt.\\n3. Using a fork or your fingers, gradually mix the eggs and salt into the flour, incorporating a little at a time.\\n4. Once the dough starts to come together, knead it with your hands until it forms a smooth and elastic ball. If the dough is too dry, you can add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired consistency.\\n5. Once the dough is formed, cover it with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for about 30 minutes. This allows the gluten to relax and makes the dough easier to work with.\\n6. After resting, divide the dough into smaller portions. Take one portion and flatten it with your hands or a rolling pin until it is about 1/4 inch thick.\\n7. If you have a pasta machine, pass the dough through the machine, starting with the widest setting and gradually decreasing the thickness until you reach the desired thickness for your pasta. If you don't have a pasta machine, you can use a rolling pin to roll out the dough until it is thin enough.\\n8. Once the dough is rolled out, you can cut it into your desired pasta shape. For example, you can cut it into thin strips for spaghetti or wider strips for fettuccine. You can also use a pasta machine attachment to cut the dough into different shapes.\\n9. After cutting the pasta, you can cook it immediately in a large pot of boiling salted water for about 2-3 minutes, or until al dente. Alternatively, you can let the pasta dry for a few hours or overnight before cooking.\\n10.
